            This is a simple workaround ( combined of an early shiro project and a real project - the same structure as in
            the real project is given, but not the real logic) sample to show, that this app deployed on a JBoss AS 7.1
            Application Server wont run properly. The problem is, that a initially setup message will is not received by
            the according actor. Also for a simple test simple stdout println's are used. Normally you should use a logger.
            This here should only reproduce the error. Also for creating this sample project some code parts are a bit
            hacked - don't worry about it. Thanks :)
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Sometimes it is needed to restart the server to reproduce the error. Remember: If you use the Jetty, then
            everything works fine. You have to use the JBoss AS 7.1 app-server!
            <br/>
            <br/>
            If everything works fine, you should see after the login during every page request a slided message, that
            the setup message is received. So the actor will perform showing a green panel with 'SETUP MESSAGE RECEIVED : )'
            <br/>
            <br/>
            How it works:
            <br/>
            TheSnippet will setup TheActor during every request - requirements are an available session and a logged in
            user - on the available session instance the method setupComet will be invoked ( using the sendCometActorMessage
            also wont work )
            <br/>
            <br/>
            BTW: You will find the login link below...
